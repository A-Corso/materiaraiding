# Raiding Terminology Glossary

There are many unusual terms and words used in FF14 raid guides, here we try to explain some of them best we can.

## AOE
Area-of-Effect, typically used to describe any mechanic or ability which affects multiple enemies/players in an area. Players will use AOE abilites in a dungeon to deal damage to multiple foes at once.

## A2C
Advance-to-clear, this is used in Party Finder to indicate a group that has cleared all the mechanics and are confident they can push for a clear. Do not join these groups if you are not confident on all the mechanics in a fight.

## CHARIOT
A large circular AOE that surrounds the boss.

## DYNAMO
A large donut AOE that surrounds the boss.

## DEFAMATION
A large circular AOE that is centered on a player. 

## PROTEAN
Cone AOEs that are targeted at several/all players in a raid.

## EXAFLARE
Delayed, sequential attacks that move in a direction. Only the first explosion is marked.

## ENUMS
A mechanic which requires a specific number of players to soak a mechanic, similar to STACK/SOAK but with a specific number of players.

## FFA (Free for All)
This is a loot rule where there is no rules, role on whatever you want and hope for the best.

## L>R (Left-to-Right)
This is a common loot rule used in groups where you are expected to roll on loot in order from left-to-right, if you get an item you are expected to leave the instance and not roll on any further items. This is to ensure loot is distributed evenly.

## MT
Main Tank, typically the Tank holding the boss aggro the most.

## OT
Off Tank, the other tank.

## PB-AOE
Point-Blank Area-of-Effect, usually an enemy ability that causes a large AOE damage area centered on the enemy.

## STACK/SOAK
A mechanic that requires the party or a number of players to stand together to share the damage taken.

## ST
Side Tank, the other tank, same as OT. Commonly used in JP.

## SPREAD
A mechanic that requires party members to spread out to prevent overlapping damage.

## TELEGRAPH or BROADCAST
The term usually used to describe the indicators we can see before a mechanic goes off, usually orange circles or lines on the ground, but can also be things that appear above players/enemies heads or any other indicator that shows you what is about to happen.

Commonly in Ultimates, many mechanics will NOT telegraph, you instead need to look at castbars or other indicators.
