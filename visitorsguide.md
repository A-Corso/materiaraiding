# Visitors Guide to Oceanic Raiding

G'day and welcome to the Oceanic datacenter, Here in the land Down Under (and surrounding regions), we do things a bit differently when it comes to ultimate raids. It's not just about throwing another shrimp on the barbie; it's about mastering the unique strategies that our local raiding community swears by. We'll explore how Oceanic raiders tackle the toughest challenges with a fair dinkum approach and what sets us apart from the rest of the FF14 world. So, let's crack on and delve into the nitty-gritty of Oceanic's ultimate raiding scene!

Thats the chatGPT bit over, don't worry that's not how we actually talk...

BUT if you fail to read the differences we will get the boot out like in that simpsons episode

## Raid Roles

In OCE we typcially use the MT, OT, H1, H2, D1 -> D4 notation to indicate who-is-who in any raid party, this means...

- MT - Main Tank
- OT - Off-Tank
- H1 - Pure/Regen Healer
- H2 - Shield Healer
- D1 - Melee DPS
- D2 - Melee DPS (or fake Melee)
- D3 - Phys Ranged DPS
- D4 - Caster

You will typically see these mentioned in Party Finder when looking for specific roles. 

## Ultimates

### UCOB

Primarily, Materia follows Clee's UCOB guide, this is common in some other regions so may not be too unfamiliar to most, see here: https://ultimates.guide/ucob/

One key difference is due to being in the sothern hemisphere, we flip the arena upside down and drop the Hatch puddles in a V shape, obviously.
