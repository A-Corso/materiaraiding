# Visitors Guide to Oceanic Raiding

G'day and welcome to the Oceanic datacenter, Here in the land Down Under (and surrounding regions), we do things a bit differently when it comes to ultimate and savage raids. It's not just about throwing another shrimp on the barbie; it's about mastering the unique strategies that our local raiding community swears by. We'll explore how Oceanic raiders tackle the toughest challenges with a fair dinkum approach and what sets us apart from the rest of the FF14 world. So, let's crack on and delve into the nitty-gritty of Oceanic's raiding scene!

This guide is aimed to help raiders with **previous experience** in current Ultimate and Savage fights transition over to OCE strats and join PFs in Materia. **If you are new to Ultimate Raiding** in OCE, we suggest exploring our full guides on this website using the navigation on the left-hand side of this page! 

## Raid Roles

In OCE we typically use the **MT, OT, H1, H2, D1, D2, D3, D4** notation to indicate who's who in any raid party, this means...

- **MT** - Main Tank
- **OT/ST** - Off-Tank
- **H1** - Pure/Regen Healer
- **H2** - Shield Healer
- **D1** - Melee DPS
- **D2** - Melee DPS (or fake Melee)
- **D3** - Phys Ranged DPS
- **D4** - Caster

You will typically see these mentioned in Party Finder when looking for specific roles and in Macros to indicate positions in certain Mechanics. 

## Macros

Macro Guides exist in some regions but are apparently foreign in others. In OCE we often share macros to indicate which strategy we are using and to share the details/refresh ourselves on a strategy during a lockout. 

Macros use the same Role notation above to explain positions and mechs in a visual way, for example, here is a macro for P11S: 

```
■【Overruling】
　D3 MT D4　　　  MTD3　　　Light: 
　H1  ▲  H2　 H1D1 ▲ H2D4　 West: G1 (MTH1D1D3) 
　D1  ST D2　　　   STD2    East: G2 (STH2D2D4)
■【Arcane Revelation】    Dark: DPS CW (Coloured WM)
　G1: West (1/4)　G2: East (2/3)
    Dark: Tank Pair Left | Healer Pair Right
■【Shadowed Messengers】
　G1: West　G2: East  
    ※ MT points boss in same lane as light clone　
　  ※ Dark tether: closest card/intercardinal ※ Light tether: middle
■【Lightstream】
　G1: CW　　G2: CCW
...
...
```

You will often see macros shared in party chat when you get into your Party Finder group, if your not sure what strat is being used for a fight, don't be afraid to ask the party leader for a Macro.

## Ultimates (Work In Progress)

### UCOB

Primarily, Materia follows Clee's UCOB guide, this is common in some other regions so may not be too unfamiliar to most, see here: [Clee's Guide](https://ultimates.guide/ucob/)

One key difference is due to being in the southern hemisphere, we flip the arena upside down and drop the Hatch puddles in a V shape, obviously.
