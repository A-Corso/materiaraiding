# Visitors Guide to Oceanic Raiding

G'day and welcome to the Oceanic datacenter, Here in the land Down Under (and surrounding regions), we do things a bit differently when it comes to ultimate and savage raids. It's not just about throwing another shrimp on the barbie; it's about mastering the unique strategies that our local raiding community swears by. We'll explore how Oceanic raiders tackle the toughest challenges with a fair dinkum approach and what sets us apart from the rest of the FF14 world. So, let's crack on and delve into the nitty-gritty of Oceanic's raiding scene!

## Raid Roles

In OCE we typically use the MT, OT, H1, H2, D1, D2, D3, D4 notation to indicate who's who in any raid party, this means...

- MT - Main Tank
- OT/ST - Off-Tank
- H1 - Pure/Regen Healer
- H2 - Shield Healer
- D1 - Melee DPS
- D2 - Melee DPS (or fake Melee)
- D3 - Phys Ranged DPS
- D4 - Caster

You will typically see these mentioned in Party Finder when looking for specific roles and in Macros to indicate positions in certain Mechanics. 

## Macros

Macro Guides exist in some regions but are apparently foreign in others. In OCE we often share macros to indicate which strategy we are using and to share the details/refresh ourselves on a strategy during a lockout. 

Macros use the same Role notation above to explain positions and mechs in a visual way, for example, here is a macro for P11S: 

```
■【Overruling】
　D3 MT D4　　　  MTD3　　　Light: 
　H1  ▲  H2　 H1D1 ▲ H2D4　 West: G1 (MTH1D1D3) 
　D1  ST D2　　　   STD2    East: G2 (STH2D2D4)
■【Arcane Revelation】    Dark: DPS CW (Coloured WM)
　G1: West (1/4)　G2: East (2/3)
    Dark: Tank Pair Left | Healer Pair Right
■【Shadowed Messengers】
　G1: West　G2: East  
    ※ MT points boss in same lane as light clone　
　  ※ Dark tether: closest card/intercardinal ※ Light tether: middle
■【Lightstream】
　G1: CW　　G2: CCW
...
...
```

You will often see macros shared in party chat when you get into your Party Finder group, if your not sure what strat is being used for a fight, don't be afraid to ask the party leader for a Macro.

## Ultimates

### UCOB

Primarily, Materia follows Clee's UCOB guide, this is common in some other regions so may not be too unfamiliar to most, see here: [Clee's Guide](https://ultimates.guide/ucob/)

One key difference is due to being in the southern hemisphere, we flip the arena upside down and drop the Hatch puddles in a V shape, obviously.

### UWU

### TEA

Materia DC follows the oldbin TEA strats that are present on the NA DC's, this means that for BJ/CC, we do the split BJ/CC strat. this is very different to the Tollgate strat that is present in JP.

in alexander intermission, we do supports left, and DPS right for long teathers, short teather is on the add to the right and no teather is to the add on the left.

for Wormhole, we follow the KR sim strat on the most part.

there is one main difference with how PA is resolved and that is how first beacons are resolved E/W rather than N/S else everything else should be close to identical to how it is resolved in NA.

as always, RESPECT STILLNESS

### DSR

Phase 2 onwards, waymarks are positioned along the walls rather than in the middle.

in phase 3: Materia does Easthogg. Niddstinien is faced north, and we resolve all arrows by facing our character east.

in Death of the Heavens in Dark Thordan: base positioning before the mecahnic starts is done H1>MT>D3>D1>D2>D4>ST>H2, dooms are positioned along the south side rather than north, and they are knocked back noth to soak their puddles. 

in Double dragons: we may resolve wroth AM's somewhat differently to what is already known. like with NA we also do fixed wyrmsbreath 1 + 2 which is different than how it is done in Elemental. tanks are also using their invuln's on cautrize at the end of double dragons.

In Dragon King Thordan, all 3 akh morn edge stacks are handled with 3-3-2 rather than 6-1-1.
