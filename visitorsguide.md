# Visitors Guide to Oceanic Raiding

G'day and welcome to the Oceanic datacenter, Here in the land Down Under (and surrounding regions), we do things a bit differently when it comes to ultimate raids. It's not just about throwing another shrimp on the barbie; it's about mastering the unique strategies that our local raiding community swears by. We'll explore how Oceanic raiders tackle the toughest challenges with a fair dinkum approach and what sets us apart from the rest of the FF14 world. So, let's crack on and delve into the nitty-gritty of Oceanic's ultimate raiding scene!

Thats the chatGPT bit over, don't worry that's not how we actually talk...

BUT if you fail to read the differences we will get the boot out like in that simpsons episode

### Raid Roles

In OCE we typically use the MT, OT, H1, H2, D1 -> D4 notation to indicate who's who in any raid party, this means...

- MT - Main Tank
- OT - Off-Tank
- H1 - Pure/Regen Healer
- H2 - Shield Healer
- D1 - Melee DPS
- D2 - Melee DPS (or fake Melee)
- D3 - Phys Ranged DPS
- D4 - Caster

You will typically see these mentioned in Party Finder when looking for specific roles and in Macros to indicate positions in certain Mechanics. 

### Macros

Macro Guides exist in some regions but are apparently foreign in others. In OCE we often share macros to indicate which strategy we are using and to share the details/refresh ourselves on a strategy during a lockout. 

Macros use the same Role notation above to explain positions and mechs in a visual way, for example, here is a macro for P11S: 

```
■【Overruling】
　D3 MT D4　　　  MTD3　　　Light: 
　H1  ▲  H2　 H1D1 ▲ H2D4　 West: G1 (MTH1D1D3) 
　D1  ST D2　　　   STD2    East: G2 (STH2D2D4)
■【Arcane Revelation】    Dark: DPS CW (Coloured WM)
　G1: West (1/4)　G2: East (2/3)
    Dark: Tank Pair Left | Healer Pair Right
■【Shadowed Messengers】
　G1: West　G2: East  
    ※ MT points boss in same lane as light clone　
　  ※ Dark tether: closest card/intercardinal ※ Light tether: middle
■【Lightstream】
　G1: CW　　G2: CCW
■【Dark & Light】
　West                             East
　Light <<<  T/H  >>>  Dark
　Dark  <<<  DPS >>>  Light
　※ Rotate CW if unsafe
　※ Light long: Stay
　　 Dark long: CW to next intercardinal
　　 Short: CW to next cardinal (DPS left, T/H right)
 ■【Dark Current】　　　　　　　   ●
　G1: West　　G2: East　　　Melee　Tank
　※ Rotate CW if unsafe　Ranged　　Healer
■【Letter of the Law】
　Tether Tank NW, Party SE 》 Rotate to safe orb
　※ Enumeration on Coloured WM

```

You will often see macros shared in party chat when you get into your Party Finder group, if your not sure what strat is being used for a fight, don't be afraid to ask the party leader for a Macro.

## Ultimates

### UCOB

Primarily, Materia follows Clee's UCOB guide, this is common in some other regions so may not be too unfamiliar to most, see here: [Clee's Guide](https://ultimates.guide/ucob/)

One key difference is due to being in the southern hemisphere, we flip the arena upside down and drop the Hatch puddles in a V shape, obviously.
