## Phase 2: Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser (WORK IN PROGRESS)

The next phase involves taking on both Brute Justice (BJ) and Cruise Chaser (CC) simultaneously. MUR follows the split bosses strat for BJCC.

In this phase, there is **a lot** going on. In saying that, depending on which role you are, a lot of these mechanics may not involve you **but it's still good to be aware of them so you are not in anyone's way and do not get hit by something you're not supposed to**.

I also do not want to clutter this section with toolbox screenshots, so please refer to the actual toolbox for exact positioning throughout this phase. Instead, this guide will focus on what events occur between each Nisi pass (and of course, if you are new to TEA, I will explain what Nisi is).

### Intro: Before First Nisi Pass

At the end of Limit Cut, players should preposition in their assigned clock spots within the green circle in the middle of the arena. This phase begins with CC appearing in the arena and BJ slamming down with **J Kick**, a heavy raidwide. 

MT takes aggro of BJ and OT takes aggro of CC. The tanks should then pull the bosses to the centre for cleave damage before taking their clock spots. As a _general guide_ melee DPS should focus hitting BJ and ranged attacking CC.

CC then casts Whirlwind, a raidwide. Then, BJ will cast Judgment Nisi, inflicting a debuff that be call Nisi on either all supports or all DPS. There will be a blue (alpha), purple (gamma), orange (beta) and green (delta) Nisi, as shown below:

![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/d7651f8d-6757-493c-a4f5-94e73600bbed)

A player carrying a Nisi will take mild DoT damage. The debuff lasts around 36 seconds in which afterwards the Nisi falls off. If a player with Nisi and a player with no debuff come in contact, the player with nothing receives the same Nisi with a fresh 36 second timer.

This is important as later in the phase, BJ will cast **Verdict** which is essentially BJ telling you, "You must have this particular colour Nisi by the end of this mechanic or wipe." So, for the first part of this phase we will just focus on juggling the Nisi around to keep all 4 colours active.

{: .warning }
If 2 players with different Nisi's combine, both players will die and as some Nisi have been lost, it will result in a wipe as you will not survive Verdict. Thus, throughout this phase, everyone must be aware of their surroundings and move carefully and with purpose, to avoid any collisions.

BJ will then cast **Link-Up**, which inflicts 1 healer with a **water debuff** and 1 DPS with a **lightning debuff**. At the end of the debuff timers, they explode - the damage of the water explosion needs to be split between at least 3 players and the lightning with at least 2 players. The debuffs are then passed onto someone who was in the stack. This won't resolve for a little while so don't worry about it just yet.

As the debuffs appear, 2 chakrams will appear on the wall 180 degrees from each other and will bait onto a random player - this is why everyone spreads closely in the middle, to ensure they pass through the middle. Everyone will then run outwards to the wall (while not being in line with a chakram) to avoid the chakrams as they cut across the arena.

{: .warning }
Since chakrams are baited they may not necessarily do a straight line across the arena and might cut in at a weird angle - when you run to the wall, make sure you are a good distance away from a chakram so you don't accidentally get clipped.

Before the chakrams go off, CC will cast **Optical Sight**. This leaves a large untelegraphed AoE below every player that will shortly explode. Once the chakrams go off, everyone should return to their clock spots in the middle green circle to dodge the explosion.

CC then casts **Photon**, which reduces everyone to 1HP and healers should quickly top players up.

{: .healers }
As Nisi's have a mild DoT, the shield healer should ensure everyone is shielded before Photon to ensure no one dies to the DoT.

After Photon, DPS will stand over their pre-assigned support partner to pass / receive their Nisi.

- D1 passes to MT
- D2 passes to H1
- D3 passes to OT
- D4 passes to H2

### After First Pass

Soon

## Temporal Stasis (Finished but needs proof reading)

This is a short "you have this debuff, so stand in this position," mechanic, but I will explain the debuffs so you can understand why the mechanic solves.

Once BJ and CC go down, the arena changes and they will reappear next to each other, left and right from the centre of the room. BJ and CC can be in either position. 

After their landing, party members will receive some debuffs. Players have approximately 8 seconds to run to their positions, in which then time will stop, freezing all players in place and the debuffs will resolve. While frozen, players cannot move or cast any abilities and their buff and cooldown timers also pause. 

Once the debuffs resolve, BJ will cast Flarethrower (conal AoE) to the 2 closest players and CC will cast Alpha Sword (conal AoE) to the 3 closest players.

### Debuffs

The debuffs are as below. They are **role-based**, One DPS and one support will receive one of the following:
- **Aggravated Assault**, shown by lightning symbol ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/36aa1af3-daa6-4c3b-8ec2-fa2e04a53f6f)
 in the debuff. These 2 players will take moderate damage and receive physical and magic vulnerabilities and therefore cannot take any other damage during the timestop, otherwise they will die.
- **Blue tether**. ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/163d6d46-601c-412c-9351-b73f1acabad2)
 These 2 players must be far apart during the timestop or they will die.
- A red and green tether, which we will call **Christmas tether**. ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/112e46c0-5aa3-4dd4-95fc-d6fb3339e28a)
 These 2 players must be close together during the timestop or they will die.
- One DPS and one support will receive **nothing**.

### Resolution

So, this is where everyone will stand to make this work:
- Both **Aggravated Assault** players run hard east/west to the wall, whichever one BJ is closest to. This ensures they are far enough to not be hit by anything.
- **No debuff** players go towards the left boss. The support will go north of the boss and the DPS will go south of the boss to bait their cleaves.
- **Christmas tether** players go towards the right boss. The support will go north of the boss and the DPS will go south of the boss to bait their cleaves. You will notice the (1) waymark will be under this boss - the width of the waymark is approximately how far the 2 players should be for the Christmas tether to resolve safely. Here's a screenshot that demonstrates that: ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/4f371937-6aab-4332-8bc7-c2a6271c8245)
- Players with the **blue tether** will be across the room from each other - support to the west, DPS to the east. The player on the side nearest BJ should stand on the wall, with the Aggravated Assault players as they will not be baiting his flarethrower. **However**, the player on the side nearest CC should stand more inwards to ensure they bait his 3rd cleave (the D and 2 waymarks are good indicators on where to stand).

Here is a diagram demonstrating the above information. Credits to Juno Dax for making this image.

![TemporalStasisJuno](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/31845dfb-fc41-4ad0-8f3c-5f6972c61b5a)

Take note that in this scenario, as CC is on the right, D2 with the blue tether is a little more inwards and not on the wall to ensure they bait that 3rd CC cleave. If CC was on the left instead, D2 would be on the wall, the Aggravated Assault players on the right with D2 (as BJ would be there) and the DH1 with blue tether would be a little more inwards to bait the CC cleave.

{: .note }
Even though buff and cooldown timers freeze, their effects still apply. For example, if you have Lucid Dreaming active during the timestop, the buff timer doesn't go down but the mana regen still ticks, giving you a little extra mana from the spell than it normally would.

Once done, time till resume, BJ and CC will leave and Alexander Prime will spawn in the middle of the arena.

## Phase 3: Alexander Prime (WORK IN PROGRESS)

The phase begins with **Chastening Heat**, which is a tankbuster on the current aggro'd player that applies a Magic Vulnerability Up. This is then followed by 3× **Divine Spear**s, tankbusters that deal magic damage. Thus, this should be dealt with via an invulnerability or tank swap.

Alexander Prime then casts his first mechanic.

### Inception Formation

Alexander Prime is untargetable for the duration of this mechanic.

Locate Alexander Prime's new location on the wall and consider this your new 'north.'

--this is a work in progress!--

### Wormhole Formation

Alexander Prime is untargetable for the duration of this mechanic.

--this is a work in progress!--

At the end of Wormhole, a party member will be marked with a stack marker which everyone should run to the centre to take. This stack requires mitigation and as everyone runs in, healers should ensure players are topped.

After, 2 DPS will have enumeration rings which must have exactly 3 people inside the circle to resolve. Facing Alexander Prime, one should move left and the other to the right. Simply use eyes and adjust on the fly. To ensure there are 3 players in each ring, both tanks should move into the left enumeration, while both healers move into the right. The 2 remaining DPS with nothing should steer clear.

Once the enumerations resolve, Alexander Prime once again becomes targetable and respawn in the middle of the arena, where he castS **Mega Holy** twice, a hardhitting raidwide which requires mitigation and healing in between.

Alexander Prime will then begin casting **Summon Alexander**, the final part of this phase.

### Summon Alexander

Alexander will spawn north, with BJ south west and CC south east of him. He begins casting **Divine Judgment**, which is an extremely long enrage timer. While BJ and CC are alive, Alexander is invulnerable, so we must kill them before we finish off Alexander.

CC will be casting **Eternal Darkness**, which wipes the party should the cast finish. 

Meanwhile, BJ enters with **J Storm**, a hard hitting raidwide. From there, every few seconds, BJ casts **J Wave**, hard hitting raidwide that also grants him a stacking damage up buff. These J Waves will require a lot of mitigation and healing - this is probably the most intensive part of the fight for healers.

The party should focus on taking down CC first, then BJ, then finishing off Alexander Prime.

Once Alexander Prime is defeated, he begins counting down for **Judgment Protocol**. A tank will need to use **Limit Break 3** when there is 4 seconds left till the cast (indicated by the chat bubble) for the party to survive this attack.

After Judgment Protocol, you will watch Perfect Alexander come to life.

## Phase 4: Perfect Alexander (WORK IN PROGRESS)

The final phase of this fight involves several debuffs which can be simply resolved by, "stand in this location," but as usual I will explain what's happening so you can understand **why**.

### The Final Word

Perfect Alexander begins by casting The Final Word and everyone will receive a debuff. 

- 1 player will be the light beacon ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/a327616d-4f59-4293-bfc5-0c1fbc081e92) and 3 will be light arrows ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/8fc1a88e-de65-4f6e-bc04-99a2bb186fe1). When the debuff expires, the light arrows are forced to march towards the light beacon for a fixed duration. In this time, if a light arrow makes contact with the light beacon they die.

- 1 player will be the dark beacon ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/01d3f745-ff2f-4c6e-8327-c746ab7379a1) and 3 will be dark arrows ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/dfc13608-2195-410a-99d1-c3acbc15c1bb). When the debuff expires, the dark arrows are forced to march away from the dark beacon for a fixed duration. In this time, if a dark arrow makes contact or is too far away from the dark beacon they die.

As soon as players get their debuffs, they should begin to preposition as per the toolbox screenshot below. This positioning ensure all the criteria are met for the debuffs to resolve without any deaths.

![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/c8692192-e30e-459a-bbff-9febe84ae051)

While prepositioning, Perfect Alexander will begin casting Ordained Stillness or Ordained Motion.

If he is casting motion, your character must be moving at the end of the cast or you will die. Jump around, use your abilities freely, I only don't recommend physically moving around otherwise you might put yourself out of position for the mechanic.

The completion of this mechanic will be denoted by a light sword falling above you.

If he is casting stillness, your character must be completely still at the end of the cast or you will die, and I mean STILL. No emoting, not mid animation of an ability cast, no autoattacks, NOTHING. This mechanic can be resolved by pressing the escape key twice and taking your hands off your keyboard (or controller).

The completion of this mechanic will be denoted by a dark sword falling above you. 

After the first Ordained Stillness/Motion, the beacon debuffs will resolve, and then Perfect Alexander will do another Ordained Stillness/Motion, the opposite of whatever he did first.

{: .warning }
If a beacon dies, all arrows of the corresponding colour will die. For instance, if your light beacon moves during stillness and dies, all light arrows will also die and the pull is basically over.

After the Final Word, Perfect Alexander will cast Optical Sight. This will be either spreads into 2 sets of stacks, or 2 sets of stacks into spreads.

The 2 party stacks do not actually need to be perfectly balanced - as long as there's more than 1 person in a stack and they aren't overlapping, the mechanic is survivable and you do not need to be pedantic about splitting the light parties perfectly.

### Fate Calibration Alpha

After, Perfect Alexander begins a short cast, spawning 4 clones of himself north and a clone of your own character will also appear. This clone appears thanks to the Enigma Codex true sight buff you received in Phase 3: Alexander Prime. 

He will then do another long Fate Calibration Alpha cast. During his long cast, you see the entire mechanic play out then once the cast is finished, he becomes untargetable and you do the mechanic for real. In this mechanic, instead of getting debuffs on your buff bar, you watch debuff happen on your clone. 

First, a dark or light sword will fall above you, indicating stillness or motion for the first part of the mechanic. Everyone will receive the same sword.

Then, the individual debuffs will show up. These include:
- **Defamation** for 1 player: can be identified by a spherical cog and an enormous explosion emitting from the player. Defamations must be taken far away from the party.
- **Shared Sentence** 1 player: identified by a flat cog with 4 circles inside. This is a small AoE that must be shared with 3 other people to survive.
- **Aggravated Assault** for 3 players: identified a small cog that strikes the players. As these leave vulnerabilities on affected players, they must not take any other damage in this mechanic.
- 3 players will receive **no debuffs** and will assist shared sentence with their stack.

Once these debuffs present themselves, another dark/light sword falls indicating the next stillness/motion. This is once again the same for everyone.

Next, 3 of 4 of the north Perfect Alexander clones will shoot **Sacrament** lasers, leaving 2 safe zones in the arena. The Alexander clone that does not shoot will **always** be one of the 2 middle ones - looking at the diagram below, if (out of the 2 middle ones), the left does not shoot, the blue areas are safe and if the right one does not shoot, the green areas are safe.

![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/89e2f6c2-a815-4493-a6f8-b6aaa150342b)

The defamation should stand on the in the northern safe zone so their explosion does not hit anyone.

As for everyone else - notice how in the bottom safe zones, each zone looks to be divided into 2 halves divided by the finger-like shape. The shared sentence and no debuffs will stack on the left, while the aggravated assaults hang around on the right, out of harm's way.

Once Perfect Alexander finishes the long Fate Calibration Alpha cast, simply stay in your spot while handling the 2 sets of stillness or motion while all the debuffs resolve.

Perfect Alexander becomes targettable again and will cast **Ordained Capital Punishment** on the highest emnity player (which should be the MT), which is a triple-hit tankbuster. Then, Perfect Alexander follows with **Ordained Punishment**, which is a single heavy tankbuster that leaves a **Physical Vulnerability Up**.

For the triple-hit, the tanks should kitchen sink their mitigations then during the cast of Ordained Punishment, the tanks should separate and the OT provokes. The MT will take the large tankbuster hit alone, then as OT will have aggro the MT with the physical vulnerability will not die an autoattack.

### Fate Calibration Beta

The next mechanic is **Fate Calibration Beta**, which is another watch-your-clone mechanic. Similar to the previous mechanic, Fate Calibration Beta will start with Perfect Alexander doing a short cast to signify the start of the mechanic, then a long cast to preview all the upcoming mechanics.

After your clone wanders around for a couple seconds, all the debuffs will appear - it will be the same beacon / forced march mechanic from The Final Word.
- **Light Beacon**: you have a light symbol above your head, your character stands near the wall and **DOES NOT MOVE**.
- **Dark Beacon**: you have a dark symbol above your head, your character stands near the wall and **DOES NOT MOVE**.
- **Light with Nothing**: if your character moves, you are not the beacon, but "light with nothing."
- **Light with Blue Tether**: you are tethered to Dark with Blue Tether and must be far from them at the end of the forced march.
- **Light with Christmas Tether**: you are tethered to Dark with Christmas Tether and must be close to them at the end of the forced march.
- **Dark with Nothing**: if your character moves, you are not the beacon, but "dark with nothing."
- **Dark with Blue Tether**: you are tethered to Light with Blue Tether and must be far from them at the end of the forced march.
- **Dark with Christmas Tether**: you are tethered to Light with Christmas Tether and must be close to them at the end of the forced march.

Then, after the forced marches, 3 Perfect Alexander clones will **Super Jump** to the west, south and east walls. These jumps will need to be baited by 3 players. After, the Perfect Alexander behind the wall at north will cast **Optical Sight**, which will be either 2 sets of light party stacks, or everyone spread out.
- If there are 2 green balls to his left and right, it is **2 light party stacks**
- If there are multiple small green orbs, it is **spreads**.

Finally, one of the clones that Super Jumped will cast **Radiant Sacrament**, a large donut AoE. At the end of the mechanic, players need to be under this clone.

To resolve Fate Calibration Beta: 
- The **Light Beacon** plants themselves on the yellow dot (commonly referred to as the nipple by players) left of the A waymark, near the wall. See as per the blue circle below:
  
![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/3ae1207d-22e5-4bab-ad39-ada5ef35f38c)

- The **Dark Beacon** plants dead centre of the 2 waymark. After the forced march, they will bait the east Super Jump.

The remaining players will then position themselves relative to the 2 waywark:
- **All light players** (regardless of what your debuff is), plus the **Dark with Christmas Tether** should stand on the north western corner of the 2 waymark. This ensures the Christmas tethers are close at the end of the march.
- **Dark with Nothing** should stand on the western side of the 2 waymark. As they have no tether to worry about, we send them hard west in the forced march, so they can bait the west Super Jump after.
- **Dark with Blue Tether** should stand on the south western corner of the 2 waymark. This puts them south to not only position them far away from the Light with Blue Tether (who will be north), but to also bait the south Super Jump after.

The diagram below shows a simple layout of where everyone will stand, given that the yellow box is the 2 waymark.

![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/cf7b09a4-89b1-469f-a9bb-b5cd7fc20ebc)

At the end of Perfect Alexander's long Fate Calibration Beta cast, the forced march resolves. After, players have a couple moments to shuffle, allowing Super Jump baiters to run to their cardinal and tethers to ensure they are the correct distance from each other. All players currently north should also group as a shared sentence will go off. 

After the tethers, shared sentence and Super Jumps resolve, players should position themselves for Optical Sight. Spread out, or if it was stack, all dark players gather mid while light players stack at A. Healers should ensure players are topped as much as possible for this part.

Upon the resolution of Optical Sight, everyone runs (sprint is helpful here) to the safe Perfect Alexander clone to survive Radiant Sacrament (donut AoE).

Perfect Alexander becomes targetable again will cast another **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment** tankbuster combo on the highest emnity target again. At this point, OT should have aggro and use their invulnerability for the entire tankbuster, with the MT provoking during the long Ordained Punishment Cast.

### Trines

This is the last new mechanic of the phase. Perfect Alexander casts **Almighty Judgment**, which previews 3 sets of AoE's (which we call **Trines**) on the ground. He then recasts the same 3 sets of AoE's for real, in which then players must dodge into the safe spots. 

The trines are set up in a way that you only need to focus on 4 points - the centre of the arena and the 1, 3 and 4 waymarks. You will only need to make 1 straight (not diagonal) movement from one point to another. To identify this, find a point that is safe for the first 2 trines (starting point), then an adjacent point that is safe for the last 2 trines (ending point). You can move from your starting point to the ending point after the 1st trine.

Players will need to move as a group because after the final trine, Perfect Alexander casts **Irresistible Grace**, a heavy-hitting stack on a random player.

After, Perfect Alexander casts another **Ordained Capital Punishment** and **Ordained Punishment** tankbuster set. MT should take te entire with their invulnerability, with OT provoking during the Ordained Punishment Cast.

Then, Perfect Alexander will do another set of trines, same mechanic as before, including the party stack. Afterwards, Perfect Alexander casts **Temporal Interference**, which initiates his enrage.

### Enrage

Perfect Alexander begins casting **Temporal Prison**, during in which he will freeze each player. Notice how in the arena (image below), there's 7 circles.

![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/3c4d3553-2f42-4656-9f95-9be5180b2b79)

Starting from the top right circle, going clockwise, Perfect Alexander will gradually place jails
