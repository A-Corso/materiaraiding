### Toolboxes

Toolboxes are an interactive guide that allows you to click through each phase indiviudally and review the mechanics in a easy to understand manner.
TEA has multiple Toolboxes, each are listed here in order of phases in the fight.

## Written Guide

Phases 1 (LL) and 2 (BJCC) coming soon. Working on it!

## Temporal Stasis Timestop

This is a short "you have this debuff, so stand in this position," mechanic, but I will explain the debuffs so you can understand why the mechanic solves.

Once BJ and CC go down, the arena will change and they will reappear next to each other, left and right from the centre of the room. 

BJ and CC can be in either position. After their landing, party members will receive some debuffs. You will have several seconds to run to your position, in which then time will stop and the debuffs resolve. You will not be able to move, cast any abilities and your buff and cooldown timers also freeze. 

Once the debuffs resolve, BJ will cast Flamethrower (conal AoE) to the 2 closest players and CC will cast Alpha Sword (conal AoE) to the 3 closest players.

### Debuffs

The debuffs are as below. They are **role-based**, One DPS and one support will one of the following:
- **Aggravated Assault**, shown by lightning symbol ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/36aa1af3-daa6-4c3b-8ec2-fa2e04a53f6f)
 in the debuff. These 2 players will take moderate damage and receive physical and magic vulnerabilities and therefore cannot take any other damage during the timestop, otherwise they will die.
- **Blue tether**. ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/163d6d46-601c-412c-9351-b73f1acabad2)
 These 2 players must be far apart during the timestop or they will die.
- A red and green tether, which we will call **Christmas tether**. ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/112e46c0-5aa3-4dd4-95fc-d6fb3339e28a)
 These 2 players must be close together during the timestop or they will die.
- One DPS and one support will receive **nothing**.

### Resolution

So, this is where everyone will stand to make this work:
- Both **Aggravated Assault** players run hard east/west to the wall, whichever one BJ is closest to. This ensures they are far enough to not be hit by anything.
- **No debuff** players go towards the left boss. The support will go north of the boss and the DPS will go south of the boss to bait their cleaves.
- **Christmas tether** players go towards the right boss. The support will go north of the boss and the DPS will go south of the boss to bait their cleaves. You will notice the (1) waymark will be under this boss - the width of the waymark is approximately how far the 2 players should be for the Christmas tether to resolve safely. Here's a screenshot that demonstrates that: ![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/4f371937-6aab-4332-8bc7-c2a6271c8245)
- Players with the **blue tether** will be across the room from each other - support to the west, DPS to the east. The player on the side nearest BJ should stand on the wall, with the Aggravated Assault players as they will not be baiting his flamethrower. **However**, the player on the side nearest CC should stand more inwards to ensure they bait his 3rd cleave (the D and 2 waymarks are good indicators on where to stand).

Here's a screenshot taken directly from the MUR toolbox which shows all of that.
![image](https://github.com/nozzyxx/materiaraiding/assets/160133948/e18a89e7-eaf3-4af8-8df6-5cac190e790b)

Take note that in this scenario, as CC is on the right, the BLM with the blue tether is a little more inwards and not on the wall to ensure they bait that 3rd CC cleave. If CC was on the left instead, the BLM would be the wall, the Aggravated Assault players on the right with the BLM (as BJ would be there) and the DRK with blue tether would be a little more inwards to bait the CC cleave.

Useful tip note: even though buff and cooldown timers freeze, their effects still apply. For example, if you have Lucid Dreaming active during the timestop, the buff timer doesn't go down but the mana regen still ticks, giving you a little extra mana from the spell than it normally would.
